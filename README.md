[![Build](https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-ai-assistant/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-ai-assistant/actions)

An AI-powered diagnostic assistant that uses NLP to understand user symptoms and recommend possible conditions and treatments securely.

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🔍 **Symptom-based diagnosis** using Sentence Transformers and semantic similarity
- 💊 **Treatment mapping** based on real-world medical knowledge
- 🔐 **Encrypted symptom storage** using `cryptography.Fernet`
- 🧱 **Modular architecture** for clean code and easy extension

---

## 🖼️ System Overview
[User] → [Symptom Input] → [Diagnosis Engine (BERT/NLP)] → [Condition Match] → [Treatment Suggestion + Logging]

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-ai-assistant.git
cd healthcare-ai-assistant

2.Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Add your medical knowledge base
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place your medical_knowledge_base_realistic.json file in the project root.

4.Run the assistant
python main.py

🚀 Optional Web Deployment
You can easily convert this into a web app using:
# streamlit_app.py
import streamlit as st
from main import run_diagnostic_system

st.title("AI Healthcare Assistant")
user_input = st.text_input("Describe your symptoms:")
if st.button("Diagnose"):
    run_diagnostic_system(user_input)
Then run:
streamlit run streamlit_app.py

📌 Example Interaction
Describe your symptoms: fever, sore throat, body ache

Analyzing symptoms with AI...

🩺 Possible Condition: Influenza (Confidence: 92.4%)
💊 Recommended Treatment: Rest, fluids, antiviral medication
🔬 Future Enhancements
✅ Integrate chatbot UI (e.g., Gradio or Langchain agent)

✅ Deploy to the cloud (Streamlit Sharing, Azure, etc.)

🔄 Expand multilingual support

🔍 Improve disease prediction with fine-tuned transformers

📦 Add database for encrypted symptom storage
